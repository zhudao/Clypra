## Download & Installation

### macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)

The recommended way to install Clypra on macOS is via **Homebrew Cask** to automatically bypass the Gatekeeper security warnings:

```bash
# Add the custom tap and install the cask
brew install AIEraDev/tap/clypra
```

Alternatively, download the direct installer from the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/AIEraDev/Clypra/releases/latest):

- **macOS Universal DMG** _(If using the DMG, drag Clypra to your `/Applications` folder, then Right-click/Control-click the icon and select **Open** to authorize execution)._

### Windows

- **Windows x64 MSI Installer**: Download from the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/AIEraDev/Clypra/releases/latest) _(If SmartScreen blocks execution, click **More Info** and select **Run Anyway**)._

### Linux

- **Linux x64 AppImage**: Download from the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/AIEraDev/Clypra/releases/latest) _(Make the file executable using `chmod +x Clypra_.AppImage`, then run).\*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Rust** and Cargo (latest stable)
- **macOS desktop builds**: FFmpeg and FFprobe are bundled as **Tauri sidecars** (`src-tauri/bin/`). The checked-in files are small wrappers that call `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` from your **`PATH`** so local `cargo tauri dev` works without copying static binaries. For release DMGs, replace them with static builds per [`src-tauri/bin/README.md`](./src-tauri/bin/README.md) (GPL/LGPL compliance, **code-signing** / notarization for sidecars). Until Linux/Windows sidecars exist, install FFmpeg on those platforms as before.

### Install FFmpeg (dev / non-macOS)

```bash
# macOS (used by sidecar wrappers until you drop in static binaries)
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg

# Or download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AIEraDev/clypra.git
cd clypra

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure API key (required for text effects and templates)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Clypra API key

# Run in development mode
npm run tauri dev
```

### API Configuration

Clypra uses the Clypra API for text effects and templates. To enable these features:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your API key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   VITE_CLYPRA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

The API key is used to authenticate requests to:

- Text effects library
- Text templates library
- Lottie animations

### Building from Source

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Build the Tauri app
npm run tauri build

# The built app will be in src-tauri/target/release/
```

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` - Build frontend
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run tauri dev` - Run Tauri app in development
- `npm run tauri build` - Build Tauri app for production

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Vite 7

**Backend:**

- Tauri 2
- Rust
- FFmpeg (via CLI)

## Usage

1. **Import Media** - Click "Import Media" to select video, audio, or image files
2. **Preview** - Use the video player controls to preview your content
3. **Edit Timeline** - Drag media to the timeline and arrange clips
4. **Trim & Adjust** - Adjust clip start/end times using the timeline
5. **Export** - Click "Export" to save your edited video

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Space` - Play/Pause video
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Scroll` - Zoom timeline
- `Trackpad Pinch` - Zoom timeline

## Architecture Highlights

### Global State Management (Zustand)

Clypra relies on a powerful and scalable state architecture using **Zustand**. State is split into logical domains to minimize unnecessary re-renders while ensuring high performance:

- **`timelineStore`**: Manages complex timeline manipulations (clips, tracks).
- **`playbackStore`**: Highly optimized store for frame-accurate playback and playhead sync.
- **`projectStore`**: Manages media assets, project settings, and history.
- **`uiStore`** & **`settingsStore`**: Handles application themes, view modes, and preferences.

### Clean Separation of Concerns

- **Components (`src/components`)** - Focused purely on declarative UI rendering. Core editor modules (Timeline, SourcePreview, PreviewPanel) are fully decoupled.
- **State (`src/store`)** - Centralized business logic and actions.
- **Utilities (`src/lib`)** - Pure functions for timeline math, FFmpeg process execution, and Tauri sidecar integration.
- **Type Safety (`src/types`)** - Strict TypeScript models for the entire editing domain.

### Performance Optimizations

- Memoized calculations for timeline rendering
- Canvas-based waveform for efficient visualization
- Async filmstrip generation to avoid blocking UI
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

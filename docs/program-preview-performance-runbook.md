# Program Preview Performance Runbook

Status: required guidance for every native Program Preview performance change.

This document records the failures found during the Program Preview investigation
and the rules that prevent repeating them. It applies only to the Program Preview
pipeline: timeline input, transport, native decode, YUV conversion, composition,
surface/readback, and final presentation.

## Scope and source of truth

The canonical implementation is split across these files:

- React request and presentation paths:
  `src/components/editor/preview/NativeProgramPreview.tsx`
- Request scheduling and obsolete-request handling:
  `src/components/editor/preview/nativePreviewScheduler.ts`
- Timeline transport and seek identity:
  `src/core/playback/TransportAuthority.ts`,
  `src/core/playback/seekController.ts`, and
  `src/core/playback/PlaybackClock.ts`
- Native commands and queue:
  `src-tauri/src/commands/native_preview.rs`
- Native performance contract and aggregation:
  `src-tauri/src/native_core/performance.rs` and
  `src-tauri/src/native_core/service.rs`
- Native compositor and RGBA readback:
  `src-tauri/src/wgpu_compositor/multi_track_composer.rs`
- Contract documentation:
  `docs/performance-contract.md`
- Playback and lookahead investigation runbook:
  `docs/native-preview-playback-performance-investigation.md`

Extend these existing contracts. Do not create a second `PerformanceSample`,
stats command, request-ID type, mode parser, or telemetry ring buffer without an
architecture decision and a migration plan.

## The two real preview paths

Playback and paused interaction are not one performance path:

```text
Timeline input
  -> TransportAuthority
  -> SeekController (requestId + generation + mode)
  -> PlaybackClock / NativeProgramPreview render loop
       |
       | playback / bounded prefetch
       v
  queue_native_frame
    -> decoder + decoder mutex
    -> bounded decoded-frame queue
  present_native_frame
    -> NV12/YUV conversion and upload
    -> native compositor
    -> native surface acquire
    -> queue submit / surface present
  -> retained native surface

       |
       | paused seek / scrub / frame step
       v
  render_native_frame
    -> RGBA frame cache
    -> decoder + decoder mutex
    -> NV12/YUV conversion and upload
    -> compositor
    -> GPU copy and RGBA readback/map
    -> IPC response
    -> canvas ImageData / putImageData
```

The direct native-surface path must remain the continuous playback path. The
RGBA bridge is a paused-frame fallback and diagnostic path, not a playback
target.

## Monitor-space ownership

Source media preview and Program Preview are separate monitor spaces. A layout
must never use one mode-switching component as both monitors or allow Source
mode to replace the Program monitor when both are visible.

- `PreviewPanel` represents one monitor and accepts an explicit `program` or
  `source` role when a layout owns both monitors.
- `PreviewMonitorWorkspace` composes the two monitors. Wide layouts use a row;
  tall and portrait layouts use a column.
- `dual-player` owns an explicit Source monitor on the left and Program monitor
  on the right.
- Source and Program have separate DOM/media lifecycles and separate playback
  contexts. Source controls claim Source transport on interaction; Program
  controls claim Program transport on interaction.
- Mount order must not decide which context receives transport commands.
- When no source asset or text preset is active, layouts show only the Program
  monitor rather than reserving a misleading empty Source monitor.

## Failure modes and permanent fixes

### 1. High-frequency logging was inside the frame path

The decoder printed one `eprintln!` for every preview frame. Console I/O is not
free and can contend with decode, async scheduling, and the desktop runtime.
That made the observed preview less smooth and polluted any timing collected
around the path.

Permanent rule:

- No `println!`, `eprintln!`, or `console.log` per preview frame in normal mode.
- High-volume events must go through the existing gated trace mechanism.
- Diagnostic logging must be disabled for benchmark runs unless the benchmark
  explicitly measures logging overhead.

### 2. Playback, seeking, and scrubbing were easy to conflate

Playback can use a retained native surface and a decoded lookahead queue.
Paused seeking and scrubbing can require decode, composition, GPU readback, IPC,
and canvas paint. A single average across those paths hides the actual cost.

Permanent rule:

- Every sample has an explicit mode: `Playback`, `PlaybackLookahead`, `Seek`,
  `Scrub`, `FrameStep`, or `Prefetch`.
- Do not infer mode by parsing a request ID.
- Do not compare playback surface timings with paused readback timings as one
  population.

### 3. Obsolete work was not the same as cancelled work

A newer seek can make an older request obsolete even when FFmpeg or GPU work
cannot stop immediately. Ignoring a result after it finishes is not equivalent
to cancelling the work, and both facts must be visible in diagnostics.

Permanent rule:

- `SeekController` generations identify the current intent.
- Scheduler abort signals cancel work where the underlying operation supports it.
- Native generation checks prevent old decoded frames entering the queue or
  surface presentation path.
- Record `stale`, `cancelled`, and `dropped` separately.

### 4. A stale frame must never become the visible target

Keeping the last valid frame visible during a seek is valid visual continuity.
Treating that frame as the newly requested frame is not. The exact request key,
project revision, frame index, and generation must still match after every
`await` before committing a paused frame.

Permanent rule:

- Stale responses may be discarded or retained only as non-visible cache data.
- Seek completion requires the exact current target.
- A failed request preserves the last valid frame and records the failure.

### 5. `lastSample` was mistaken for an average

`lastSample` is one sample. It is not a mean, median, or percentile. A latest
sample overlay can look healthy while the preceding requests were slow.

Permanent rule:

- Label latest values as latest.
- Use the existing five-second window and P50/P95/P99 values for claims about
  performance.
- Percentile `sampleCount` counts only samples that contain that optional stage.

### 6. Seek telemetry mixed unrelated requests

Pooling all samples into a seek statistic lets playback, lookahead, cache hits,
and prefetch change the reported seek latency.

Permanent rule:

- Seek summaries include only `Seek`, `Scrub`, and `FrameStep` samples.
- Playback and lookahead have separate mode buckets.
- Cold/warm cache state, quality, output size, and media characteristics are
  included in every benchmark report.

### 7. Direct native-surface playback was missing from detailed statistics

The retained surface path can be the visible playback path while the detailed
RGBA frame-service stats describe only readback frames. That makes the overlay
look incomplete exactly when the important path is active.

Permanent rule:

- Surface playback records decode, conversion/upload, composition, surface
  acquisition, submit/present, total time, and queue staging wait.
- Surface staging is not an RGBA frame-cache hit.
- `window_cache_hit_rate` remains scoped to the RGBA cache population.

### 8. Missing stages were represented as zero

A native-surface frame has no canvas paint or RGBA readback. A readback frame has
no surface acquisition or native submit. Recording zero makes an absent stage
look like a measured zero and corrupts percentiles.

Permanent rule:

- Path-specific stage fields are `Option`/nullable.
- `None` means the stage did not exist or was not measured.
- Zero is used only when zero work was actually measured.

### 9. Rust and browser clocks cannot be aligned directly

Rust `Instant` and browser `performance.now()` have no defined shared epoch.
Joining them as one timestamp stream creates false queue and presentation
latencies.

Permanent rule:

- Record durations locally in each process.
- Correlate reports by string `requestId`, generation, and frame index.
- Never subtract a Rust timestamp from a browser timestamp.

### 10. Instrumentation must not become the bottleneck

Telemetry that waits on the frame-service mutex or logs synchronously can change
the behavior it is intended to measure.

Permanent rule:

- Frontend telemetry is disabled by default and stored in a bounded ring buffer.
- Native-surface sample recording uses a non-blocking service-mutex attempt.
- A missed diagnostic sample is preferable to delaying frame presentation.
- Never stream one JSON log line per frame during a benchmark.

### 11. The playback loop must not render the same timeline twice

The mixed timeline in the incident exposed a compounded frontend cost: the
quality manager selected a tier but the native request still used the full
sequence dimensions; every playback tick awaited WebView rasterization for
text, images, masks, and smart overlays; and the loop could then build a second
look-ahead scene before presenting anything. When one frame fell behind, the
second scene increased the backlog instead of helping it. This also explains
why pause/play felt blocked: the control was responsive, but the render loop
continued expensive work before the next visible state settled.

The permanent playback contract is:

- `PreviewQualityManager` is the single policy for native output dimensions.
  Playback uses the selected Full/High/Med/Proxy tier; interaction uses the
  lower interaction tier; export keeps its own export profile. Output width,
  height, and quality are part of the native request identity.
- Playback is a latest-frame stream. After each awaited WebView raster stage,
  compare project, epoch, transport state, and frame index. If the clock moved,
  abandon the obsolete work and schedule the current frame.
- The visible playback loop builds one scene and one request per tick. It does
  not render a second look-ahead scene. Native queue/prefetch is the only
  bounded decode warm-up mechanism, and it must not be launched from the
  visible playback RAF because queue_native_frame shares the decoder mutex
  with presentation. Session startup decoder prewarming is the safe cold-start
  path; text assets have their separate isolated prewarm path.
- Existing text boundaries are fully prewarmed during native session
  initialization. Opening does not complete while browser font loading, native
  font registration, or text-effect rasterization is still in flight. Newly
  inserted text uses a deferred look-ahead prewarm of up to eight seconds;
  neither path may decode a second visible video frame or block transport
  controls.
- The interactive decoder owns the sequential playback stream and retains its
  last raw NV12 frame. Re-presenting the initial frame at the stopped-to-playing
  boundary must be a cache reuse, not a second FFmpeg seek. Any future decode
  ahead must live inside this native owner; a second WebView IPC command must
  never contend for the same decoder mutex.
- Project creation, project opening, and crash-session recovery are gated by a
  blocking initialization modal. The modal is driven by the project-store
  lifecycle state, reports the active phase, and remains visible until the
  timeline and preview session are ready. This makes text/font prewarming an
  explicit startup contract instead of hidden work racing the first play.

### 12. The native surface is a session resource, not a component side effect

The native preview surface is process-global because it is hosted by a retained
Tauri child window. Treating it as a set of independent React side effects made
geometry updates, project cleanup, and frame presentation race one another. A
resize could hide the only visible frame, expose an empty DOM canvas, and then
wait indefinitely for a paused render loop to wake.

The permanent ownership contract is:

- `nativeSurfaceLifecycle.ts` is the sole owner of surface configure, resize,
  present ordering, and release. Preview components may request a transaction;
  they must not call native surface commands directly.
- Every configure request has a monotonically increasing revision. A stale
  revision cannot overwrite a newer project or geometry transaction.
- Same-owner geometry changes are non-destructive: the retained surface stays
  visible while the child window is moved/resized, and the next presentation is
  serialized behind that operation.
- Project release is the only normal path that hides the surface. It runs after
  all earlier presentations and clears ownership so a later project cannot be
  hidden by stale cleanup.
- Completing a surface transaction wakes the event-driven paused renderer. A
  native resize must never rely on an unrelated timeline event to repaint.
- The native child window receives one canonical monitor-space rectangle from
  the DOM viewport. Coordinate-space conversion belongs at that boundary and
  must not be patched with fixed header offsets or render-scale adjustments.
- The visible Program Preview render loop is also gated by that lifecycle
  state. It must not start while the project is exposed to React but its
  `ProjectSession` is still initializing, and it must use the active session's
  shared raster bridge. A modal that only covers the UI is insufficient if a
  background RAF can still issue a stopped-state native render during startup.
- Project transitions are serialized. A second open/create/close request waits
  for the current transition, and close awaits native-surface hide, save and
  crash-recovery flush, session disposal, media release, store reset, timeline
  reset, and snapshot cleanup before the project is removed from the UI. Native
  surface lifecycle commands use the same queue as React cleanup so repeated
  close/open cannot hide the next project's surface.
- Built-in editor fonts are vendored as local WOFF2 assets. The application
  must not import Google Fonts globally or invoke the engine's Google Fonts
  injection path for a bundled family. The application font boundary resolves
  bundled aliases to the local CSS family and reserves the remote fallback for
  genuinely custom families only. This keeps font loading deterministic and
  prevents a network stylesheet from appearing at a text boundary during
  playback.
- Static raster inputs use content/configuration-based asset identities and
  may be reused across frames. Time-dependent inputs, such as shaders, remain
  frame-addressed until they have a native procedural implementation.
- The retained native surface is the playback target. RGBA readback and canvas
  painting are for paused seek/scrub fallback only.

The 2026-08-28 fix applied these rules in `NativeProgramPreview` and
`NativeRasterBridge`. It does not claim a hardware frame-rate result by itself;
the benchmark below must be run on representative mixed timelines to establish
the baseline.

### 13. Playback render graph ownership and frame budget

The native playback path is a real-time frame stream. Its critical path is

`audio clock → scene snapshot → immutable asset references → native decode →
GPU conversion/composition → surface present`.

The following are session resources and must be created during session setup or
on a controlled configuration change, never while presenting a frame:

- compositor shader modules, pipelines, bind-group layouts, samplers, LUT, and
  default mask;
- dynamic layer-uniform storage and its bind group;
- native text/image asset registrations and decoder warm-up.

Per-frame work is limited to advancing the clock, decoding the needed source
frame, updating dynamic uniforms, and submitting the current surface frame.
Text/image pixels are immutable assets. Position, opacity, rotation, z-order,
and blend mode are per-frame compositor values; changing them must not trigger
Canvas rasterization, font shaping, or a new native asset upload. Time-varying
effects are the explicit exception and must use a bounded latest-frame policy.

The retained surface is the visual continuity buffer. The playback scheduler
may drop obsolete frame requests, but it must never allow an older request to
overwrite a newer generation or block the audio clock behind speculative
readback work. Readback remains an interaction/export path, not the playback
path.

### 14. Regression acceptance criteria for future integrations

Before merging a new clip type, renderer, effect, or preview integration:

- [ ] A 60-second mixed timeline remains responsive while playing, scrubbing,
      and pausing; controls must not await preview completion.
- [ ] A slow frame cannot present after a newer frame, seek generation, or
      project epoch becomes current.
- [ ] Playback requests report the selected output dimensions and quality;
      they do not silently fall back to sequence-sized full output.
- [ ] The integration has an explicit static/time-dependent cache policy and a
      bounded byte/entry budget.
- [ ] The benchmark table below includes warm/cold state, output dimensions,
      quality, native-surface readiness, and stale/dropped counts.
- [ ] The focused scheduler/quality tests and the native Rust checks pass.

## Required investigation procedure

Before changing React scheduling, UI rendering, or native policy:

1. Confirm the actual repository types and call sites. Read the canonical files
   above; do not write speculative standalone modules against guessed fields.
2. Trace one frozen playback, seek, and scrub scenario end to end.
3. Capture the mode, request ID, generation, frame index, queue state, stale/
   cancelled/dropped outcome, and each applicable native/frontend duration.
4. Compare P50/P95/P99 by mode and path. Do not rank a bottleneck from symptoms
   or from code structure alone.
5. Change the smallest diagnostic surface that distinguishes the leading
   candidates.
6. Re-run the same scenario with logging disabled and enabled separately if
   logging is suspected.
7. Only after native timings identify the cost should UI or React work be
   considered.

### Reproducing a lifecycle/playback hang

In a development build, reproduce in this order: open the existing project,
press Play, wait for the first visible boundary, press Pause, then seek across
the first text and image boundaries. The React diagnostics use the existing
structured playback trace and now include `project-lifecycle-*`,
`surface-*`, `playback-state`, `native-present-*`, and
`pause-surface-handoff` events. Capture the complete sequence from the first
`project-lifecycle-start` through the freeze or blank frame; do not capture
only the final toast.

For a production-like debug run, enable the bounded trace before reproducing:

```js
localStorage.setItem("clypra:debug:playback", "1");
```

Disable it afterward with `localStorage.removeItem("clypra:debug:playback")`.

## Benchmark record

Every meaningful preview performance change must attach a table like this to the
investigation or release notes:

| Scenario | Path | Mode | Warm/cold | P50 total | P95 total | P95 decode | P95 compose | P95 readback | P95 surface acquire | Drops/stale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Playback | Native surface | Playback |  |  |  |  |  | N/A |  |  |
| Seek | RGBA readback | Seek |  |  |  |  |  |  | N/A |  |
| Scrub | RGBA readback | Scrub |  |  |  |  |  |  | N/A |  |

Record OS, GPU adapter, backend, driver, DPR, source codec/dimensions, CFR/VFR
status, color metadata, project dimensions, quality, and whether the native
surface was ready. A benchmark without those details is not a regression
baseline.

## Safe change and release checklist

- [ ] `git status` and the existing diff were inspected before editing.
- [ ] Only files in the traced preview path were changed.
- [ ] Existing request IDs remain strings and existing wire spellings remain
      compatible (`frameStep` is normalized at the boundary).
- [ ] No duplicate performance type or diagnostics command was added.
- [ ] Playback, seek, scrub, frame-step, and prefetch remain separate modes.
- [ ] Optional stages remain nullable and are excluded from unrelated
      percentiles.
- [ ] Direct native-surface frames are represented in performance statistics.
- [ ] Cache-hit statistics exclude surface staging frames.
- [ ] High-volume logging is gated or disabled for benchmarks.
- [ ] Stale results cannot present or complete a newer seek.
- [ ] `cargo check --lib`, Rust tests, and `npm run typecheck` pass.
- [ ] The same fixed benchmark scenarios were repeated after the change.
- [ ] No optimization is claimed until the native timings identify the cost.

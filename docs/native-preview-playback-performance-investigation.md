## 2. Forensic Investigation & Bugs Resolved

### Bug 1: Cold Playback Jitter & Lookahead Starvation
- **Symptom**: Scrubbed playback was smooth, but pressing "Play" for the first time resulted in audio playing while video stuttered and jumped.
- **Root Cause**: Playback started with an empty cache. Presentation threads competed with cold decoding on every frame.
- **Solution**:
  1. Lookahead buffer priming: On playback session start (`NativeRenderSession::start`), the lookahead engine eagerly primes 16 frames into `NativePreviewFrameQueue` before presentation deadlines hit.
  2. Pause-on-seek predecoding: Seeking triggers immediate predecoding around the target playhead position so the cache is warm before playback resumes.

### Bug 2: The Backward Seek Trap (Frame #41 Anomaly)
- **Symptom**: During 4K 60fps playback (`Mod - Is Jude Bellingham...`), frames #1 through #40 ran smoothly via `[QUEUE_HIT]` at ~11ms decode. At Frame #41, playback collapsed into repeated cold decodes and dropped frames.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. Lookahead pre-decoded up to Frame 40 ($28 + 12 = 40$). The FFmpeg decoder state was parked at Frame 40.
  2. Lookahead worker finished its batch and exited.
  3. Presentation progressed to Frame 33 and scheduled a new lookahead worker.
  4. The new worker read `audio_clock_time` (Frame 33) and checked `queue.contains(33)`. Because presentation had already `take()`n Frame 33, it was absent.
  5. The new worker requested Frame 33!
  6. Asking FFmpeg for Frame 33 when parked at Frame 40 forced a **backward keyframe seek**, costing **349.57ms** on 4K footage.
  7. This 350ms seek held the decoder mutex, starving presentation of Frame 41 and causing an irrecoverable domino of cold decodes.
- **Architectural Rule**:
  - **Lookahead must ALWAYS be strictly forward**:
    $$\text{start} = \max(\text{audio\_frame} + 1, \text{highest\_frame\_index} + 1)$$
  - Never allow a lookahead worker to decode a frame index $\le$ any frame already decoded or in flight.

### Bug 3: The 16-Frame Boundary Stall & Sub-Millisecond Jitter
- **Symptom**: Every 16 frames (Frames 821, 837, 901, 965, 982, 997, 1013, 1029, 1045, etc.), lookahead hit a 250ms–450ms decode spike on boundary frames.
- **Root Causes**:
  1. `target_source_secs` was computed using floating-point `audio_clock_time` differences across worker boundaries:
     $$\Delta t = \text{target\_time\_secs} - \text{base\_timeline\_secs}$$
     Microsecond clock jitter between ticks caused newly spawned workers to request timestamps fractionally earlier ($0.0005\text{s}$) than where the decoder had finished.
  2. In `decoder.rs`, `can_decode_forward` checked `target_pts <= self.current_pts`. Even a 1-tick PTS difference triggered `av_seek_frame(..., AVSEEK_FLAG_BACKWARD)` and `self.decoder.flush()`, seeking backwards to the previous GOP keyframe.
  3. Boundary frames were decoded twice because `highest_frame_index` was only updated on `complete()`.
- **Architectural Rules**:
  - **Integer Frame Math Only**: Source time in lookahead must be strictly derived from integer frame offsets:
    $$\text{target\_source\_frame} = \text{base\_source\_frame} + (\text{target\_frame\_index} - \text{base\_frame\_index})$$
    $$\text{target\_source\_secs} = \frac{\text{target\_source\_frame}}{\text{fps}}$$
  - **Immediate In-Flight Reservation**: `NativePreviewFrameQueue::begin` advances `highest_frame_index` the moment a frame starts decoding.

### Bug 4: Terminal Backpressure & Global `eprintln!` Contention
- **Symptom**: Presentation total time spiked to 400ms+ even when `decode + upload + compose + present` only totaled 3.5ms.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. Rust's `eprintln!` acquires a global mutex (`io::stderr().lock()`). Multiple Tokio tasks and the render loop blocked each other waiting for stderr.
  2. Synchronous `write(2)` syscalls (60–120/sec) saturated the OS pipe buffer between Tauri and the terminal emulator (Vite / Terminal.app / VSCode). Once the pipe buffer filled, `write()` blocked the render thread for up to 50ms.
- **Architectural Rules**:
  - **Log by Exception**: Only log when a frame violates the 33.33ms budget (`total_ms > 33.33` or `predecode_ms > 33.33`) or cold-decodes (`!queue_hit`). Smooth 60fps playback must produce **zero per-frame stderr I/O**.
  - **Periodic Rollups**: Summary logs (`📊 [NativePlayback Summary]`) only print once every 60 frames (every 2s).
  - **In-Memory Telemetry**: Real-time metrics are tracked via `SYNC_METRICS` (atomic counters and percentiles) and emitted via Tauri event `"native-playback-stats"`.
  - **Override Flag**: Full verbose logs can be enabled via `CLYPRA_VERBOSE_PREVIEW=1`.

### Bug 5: 23.976 FPS Pulldown Cadence & Ultra-Long GOP Thrashing (`Video by jomakaze`)
- **Symptom**: `Video by jomakaze [DaUvB4QJzOk].mp4` (1080x1920 VP9) stuttered severely with decode times growing linearly from 40ms to 500ms, while all other videos played smoothly.
- **Root Cause**:
  1. `Video by jomakaze` is 23.976 FPS with a **120-frame (5-second) keyframe interval**.
  2. On a 30 FPS timeline, 4 video frames span 5 timeline ticks ($\frac{30}{24} = 1.25$). Exactly once every 5 timeline frames, a video frame is held (repeated).
  3. The requested timestamp on repeated frames had a backward distance of $\sim 19.7\text{ms}$ (237 PTS ticks).
  4. Hardcoded `pts_tolerance` assuming 30fps was only 16.6ms ($0.5 / 30.0$).
  5. Because $19.7\text{ms} > 16.6\text{ms}$, the decoder treated the repeated frame as a backward seek. It sought back to **Frame 0 (up to 5 seconds in the past)** and decoded 80+ frames of 1080x1920 VP9 from the beginning, only to arrive at the exact frame it already had!
- **Architectural Rules**:
  - **Stream-Aware PTS Tolerance**: Derive tolerance from the actual video stream's frame rate:
    $$\text{pts\_tolerance} = (0.95 \times \text{frame\_duration}) \times \frac{\text{time\_base.den}}{\text{time\_base.num}}$$
  - If requested PTS is within `pts_tolerance` of `last_raw_nv12`, return the cached frame in **0.01ms** without seeking.
  - Backward seek is ONLY triggered if `backward_distance > pts_tolerance`.

### Bug 6: Tokio Reactor Panic on Main Thread / Non-Tokio Context
- **Symptom**: Seeking suddenly caused the entire application to crash with:
  ```text
  thread 'main' (7752458) panicked at src/commands/native_preview.rs:2064:18:
  there is no reactor running, must be called from the context of a Tokio 1.x runtime
  fatal runtime error: failed to initiate panic, error 5, aborting
  ```
- **Root Cause**: `tokio::spawn` requires the calling thread to belong to an active Tokio 1.x multi-threaded runtime. When `schedule_lookahead_predecode` or seek handlers were invoked from synchronous handlers or the OS main GUI thread (thread `main`), `tokio::spawn` panicked and aborted the process.
- **Architectural Solution**:
  - Replaced direct `tokio::spawn` with `tauri::async_runtime::spawn`.
  - Added an atomic completion flag (`finished: Arc<AtomicBool>`) in `LookaheadWorkerState` so worker lifecycle checks are lock-free and completely runtime-agnostic without depending on Tokio-specific join handle extensions.

### Bug 7: Transport Auto-Resume on Timeline Seek & Playhead Scrub
- **Symptom**: Seeking or scrubbing the playhead while video was playing immediately resumed playback, causing rapid seek/render thrashing and unexpected audio playback before the user inspected the frame.
- **Root Cause**: `PlaybackClock.seek()` stored `wasPlaying = this._state === "playing"` and called `this.play()` at the end of every seek.
- **Architectural Solution**:
  - Removed `if (wasPlaying) this.play()` from `PlaybackClock.seek()`. Seeking now cleanly pauses the clock and stays paused.
  - Added active playback pause in `TransportAuthority.seek()` and `SourcePlaybackContext.seek()`.
  - Set `previewInteractionCoordinator.commit(..., false)` on playhead scrub release so scrubbing does not restart playback. The user manually presses Play (or Spacebar) to continue.

### Bug 8: Overlay Lifecycle Decoupling & Lookahead Cache Preservation
- **Symptom**: In continuous playback containing text overlays, stickers, or title animations, playback ran at 30/60 FPS with 99.6% lookahead queue hits during the animation (Frames #115 to #427). However, at the exact moments the overlay entered (Frame #113 $\rightarrow$ #114) and exited (Frame #427 $\rightarrow$ #428), playback experienced severe freezes:
  ```text
  [NativePlayback] Persistent background render worker STOPPED
  [NativePlayback] Persistent background render worker STARTED
  [NativePresent] Frame #114 [COLD_DECODE] total: 419.00ms
  ...
  [NativePlayback] Persistent background render worker STOPPED
  [NativePlayback] Persistent background render worker STARTED
  [NativePresent] Frame #429 [COLD_DECODE] total: 454.98ms
  ```
- **Root Causes**:
  1. **Structural Snapshot Key Pollution**: In `src/core/playback/nativePlaybackSnapshot.ts`, `buildNativePlaybackSnapshotKey` serialized an `overlays` array into the key. Before the clip, `overlays` was `[]`; at clip entrance, `overlays` became `[{"id":"clip-1","role":"text"}]`; at clip exit, it reverted to `[]`. This caused `ensureNativePlaybackRenderSnapshot` in `NativeProgramPreview.tsx` to detect a false structural graph change at clip boundaries.
  2. **Worker Teardown & Lookahead Purge**: `configure_native_playback_render` in `src-tauri/src/commands/native_playback.rs` called `previous.stop()` and `queue.reset()`, terminating the background decoding thread and discarding all 24 frames of warm, pre-decoded video lookahead cache. The transport was forced into an unbuffered synchronous cold decode (~420–455ms).
  3. **Rigid Demand Validation**: In `native_playback.rs`, `materialize_request` previously asserted `demand_overlays == configured_overlays` and rejected dynamic demands whenever the overlay count changed ($0 \to 1$ or $1 \to 0$), forcing frontend demand submission to fail and trigger full session reconfiguration.
  4. **Lookahead Cache Key Discrepancy**: In `src-tauri/src/native_core/contracts.rs`, `FrameRequest::cache_key()` hashed `project.raster_layers` and `project.text_layers`. Because `NativePreviewFrameQueue` stores raw decoded video frames (`DecodedNativeVideoFrame`), hashing overlay state caused hash mismatches on boundary frames.
- **Architectural Solution (Decoupling Overlays from Hardware Decoding Sessions)**:
  1. **Pure Hardware Decoding Session Identity**: `buildNativePlaybackSnapshotKey` now defines structural identity strictly by hardware video decoding resources: video layers/streams (`videoLayers`), canvas dimensions, project revision, frame rate, output dimensions, and transitions. Overlay arrays are entirely excluded.
  2. **Dynamic Per-Frame Overlay Stream**: Overlays (text, stickers, dynamic rasters) are transported as dynamic per-frame demands via `NativePlaybackFrameDemand` submitted to `submit_native_playback_demand`.
  3. **Dynamic Layer Materialization in Rust**: Removed the overlay count check in `materialize_request`. Rust dynamically instantiates or removes `RasterLayerSnapshot`s in microseconds without restarting the worker thread or resetting the queue, maintaining layer identity matching by `layer_id` and propagating `blend_mode` and `is_mask`.
  4. **Normalized Video Lookahead Cache Key**: In `contracts.rs`, `cache_key()` clears `raster_layers` and `text_layers` before computing the SHA256 digest. Lookahead video frames match with 100% hash accuracy regardless of text/sticker appearances.

## 4. Engineering Invariants (Rules of Thumb)

1. **Never Seek Backward for Intra-Frame Jitter**: If `target_pts < current_pts`, verify whether the delta is within the stream's frame duration. Never flush the decoder for intra-frame rounding or pulldown repetition.
2. **Never Call `eprintln!` on Per-Frame Hot Paths**: All per-frame logging must be gated by anomaly thresholds (`> 33.33ms`) or `VERBOSE_LOGS`.
3. **Always Advance Lookahead Strictly Forward**: Never calculate lookahead start from scratch without checking `highest_frame_index`.
4. **Drain Decoder DPB Before Demuxing**: In `decode_frame_raw_nv12_with_cancel`, always drain frames already decoded in the codec buffer before feeding new packets from the container.
5. **Preserve Stream Decoder Isolation**: Stacked video clips must use distinct stream decoder handles (`get_preview_decoder_for_stream`) to avoid GOP mutex thrashing across layers.
6. **Always Use `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` on Native Public/Sync APIs**: Never call `tokio::spawn` directly in synchronous functions or handlers that may be called from OS GUI threads.
7. **Always Pause on Timeline Seek/Scrub**: Seeking is a playhead navigation action that must leave playback paused until the user explicitly requests playback continuation.
8. **Decouple Dynamic Overlays from Hardware Decoder Graphs**: Text, stickers, and dynamic rasters are compositor overlay demands, never structural decoding graphs. Their appearance, disappearance, or animated transform parameters must never restart the background render worker, clear the lookahead queue, or invalidate `buildNativePlaybackSnapshotKey`.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-08-27

### 🔤 Native GPU SDF Text Engine & Font Registry
- **Native Signed Distance Field (SDF) text rendering** — migrated text rendering from browser canvas to GPU-accelerated wgpu/WGSL SDF shaders for razor-sharp typography at any preview scale.
- **Native font registry & WOFF2 support** — added `register_native_font` / `register_native_font_bytes` IPC commands; native core automatically decodes bundled WOFF2 and TTF fonts via `woff2-patched`.
- **Per-glyph font fallback & Noto Emoji** — `render_text_sdf_aligned_with_fallback` seamlessly resolves missing glyphs to the bundled `@fontsource/noto-emoji` fallback font.
- **Synthetic weight & italic transforms** — pre-SDF bitmap dilation and skewing synthesize bold and italic styles for single-weight fonts.
- **Contract v2 text snapshots** — extended native contract to v2, introducing text runs for timed karaoke/captions, vertical alignment, and multi-pass text shaders.
- **Native text templates & compound clip reuse** — text templates instantiate natively with full styling and shader passes preserved across export and preview.
- **Retired browser text rasterization** — desktop preview and export render text layers directly via wgpu, removing canvas raster roundtrips and DOM bottlenecks.

### 🔊 Professional Audio Engine & Timeline Controls
- **Extended native audio mixer** — Rust mixer supports fade-in / fade-out curves, keyframe interpolation, pan, channel routing, and pitch preservation.
- **Interactive audio envelope editor** — CapCut-style volume rubber bands and fade handle knobs directly on clips with cubic Bézier curves.
- **J/L-cut audio unlinking** — added `UnlinkAudioCommand` and `RelinkAudioCommand` for independent audio/video trimming and J/L cut workflows.
- **Atomic audio graph updates** — `replaceNativeAudioClips` IPC synchronizes audio edits in-place without restarting playback decoders.
- **Desktop Web Audio engine** — browser desktop audio path honors clip-level `preservePitch` with smooth time-stretching.
- **Waveform fade curves & solo button** — waveforms render overlaid fade curves with source-scoped peak caching and per-track solo controls.

### 🔄 Session-Safe Deferred Updates & Auto-Updater Pipeline
- **Two-stage update lifecycle** — separated update download from installation via `AutoUpdateManager` singleton; active editing sessions are never interrupted.
- **Save-before-update verification** — transport playback is paused and project state is atomically saved and verified before update restart; save failures abort installation safely.
- **Unified updater state** — synchronized update notifications, downloading status, and restart prompts across SettingsModal and UpdateBanner.

### 💾 Project Persistence Reliability & Crash Recovery
- **Atomic save pipeline** — verified candidate write (`.tmp`), generation rotation (`.bak`), and atomic file replacement with save receipt verification.
- **Transactional project hydration** — `validateAndMigrateProjectPayload` safely migrates legacy project fields; hydration failures roll back to the previously active project.
- **Failure-isolated recent projects** — corrupt or unreadable projects no longer hide valid projects and offer one-click recovery from verified backup files.
- **Crash recovery snapshot v2** — IndexedDB snapshot persists timeline gaps, markers, and schema version.
- **Cross-platform save hardening** — resolved Windows backup rename races and mobile Capacitor overwrite/rename paths.

### 🖥️ Dual-Monitor Workspace & Preview Layouts
- **Dual-monitor preview workspace** — added `PreviewMonitorWorkspace` supporting configurable side-by-side row and stacked column orientations for Source and Program monitors.
- **Independent preview panels** — `PreviewPanel` supports an explicit `mode` prop ("program" vs "source") regardless of global preview state.
- **Interaction-deferred transport context** — `SourcePreview` defers transport claiming until user interaction, preventing accidental playback hijacking on mount.

### 🎨 Design System, Semantic Tokens & Clip Palettes
- **Per-theme clip palettes** — clip colors derive from dynamic semantic design tokens (`--clypra-clip-*`) mapped 1-to-1 with UI themes.
- **Full palette fidelity** — eliminated heavy CSS saturation and opacity filters that dulled theme palette colors.
- **Live theme preview swatches** — Settings theme swatches preview actual built-in clip palette color schemes.

### 📐 Timeline Viewport Precision & Interactions
- **Sub-pixel alignment & 20px clip-start offset** — consistent timeline coordinates across Ruler, Clips, Playhead, Gaps, and mouse/wheel seek anchors via `TIMELINE_CLIP_START_OFFSET_PX`.
- **Refined visual hierarchy** — distinct A-roll (primary) and B-roll visual roles with dedicated track heights.
- **Visual track ordering guards** — visual tracks are prevented from being placed below the main video track, enforced across drag/drop and history undo/redo.
- **CapCut-style ruler** — clean ticks with compact `MM:SS` formatting under one hour and `HH:MM:SS` timecodes for longer projects.
- **Spring-animated zoom & canonical overview** — buttery-smooth anchored wheel zoom with spring physics; projects reliably open at standard minimum zoom.

### ⚡ Performance, Telemetry & Lookahead Pre-fetching
- **Zero-PII performance telemetry** — lightweight client and collector reporting stage timings and dropped frames with adaptive sampling.
- **Bounded lookahead pre-fetching** — predictive decoding warms upcoming clip assets within a 3-second horizon without saturating GPU presentation.
- **Event-driven paused render loop** — native preview pauses RAF loops while stopped, waking instantaneously on state and transform changes.
- **24-track compositor density** — validated multi-track layer pooling and composition stability up to 24 concurrent tracks.

### 🛠️ UI Polish & Workflow Shortcuts
- **Collapsible properties panel** — 44px collapsed rail with expand button and shortcut icons; `Alt+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P` toggle shortcut.
- **Media library shortcut** — `Cmd+B` toggles the media library drawer.
- **Transform overlay polish** — RAF-throttled gizmo tracking, enlarged hit targets, and diagonal resize cursors.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-08-25

### ⚡ Program Preview Performance

- **Smoother native Program Preview playback and scrubbing** — removed high-frequency decoder console I/O from the frame path and kept native-surface diagnostics from blocking presentation.
- **Native-surface playback telemetry** — added optional timings for decoder wait/decode, YUV conversion/upload, composition, surface acquisition, and present submission.
- **RGBA readback telemetry** — separated compositor time from GPU readback/map time for paused seeking and scrubbing.
- **Mode-aware preview statistics** — performance data is partitioned across playback, lookahead, seek, scrub, frame-step, and prefetch with P50/P95/P99 stage percentiles.
- **Frontend preview tracing** — added bounded dispatch, IPC, and canvas-paint measurements keyed by request ID, generation, and frame index.
- **Accurate cache metrics** — native-surface staging frames are no longer counted as RGBA frame-cache hits.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-08-25

### ✂️ Timeline Editing

- **Ripple-left trim no longer creates a gap** — left-edge ripple trim now keeps the clip anchored at its start time; only `trimIn` and duration are updated, and downstream clips shift left cleanly.
- **Atomic undo/redo for trim gestures** — every trim (including ripple-trim) is committed as one `TimelineTrimCommand` that restores clips, gaps, and downstream positions together.
- **Atomic undo/redo for clip drag** — moving or dropping clips — including onto a new track — creates a single `TimelineDragCommand` entry; undo restores tracks, clips, gaps, and ordering exactly.
- **New-track drops land at the pointer position** — clips no longer jump to `startTime = 0`; snapping remains active within 8 px of valid targets.
- **Departure-gap closure** — when a clip moves to a new track only the gap it leaves behind is closed; earlier gaps on the source track are preserved.
- **Split selects only the right clip** — after splitting, only the continuation clip is selected so Delete removes just the new half.
- **Atomic split-all at playhead** — splitting all clips at once is wrapped in a single history transaction for a one-step undo.
- **Swap clips is undoable** — `SwapClipsCommand` validates locks, same-track moves, and collisions before committing and updates transition references.
- **Duplicate clips is undoable** — `DuplicateClipsCommand` regenerates IDs recursively through compound clip trees.

### 🗂️ Clip Organisation

- **Compound Clips (Group Clips)** — select multiple clips and press **Alt+G** (or use the context menu) to collapse them into one movable unit. Ungroup restores the originals. Compound clips are single-track only.
- **Clip rename** — right-click any clip and choose **Rename Clip**, or use the context menu's rename item; the change is fully undoable.
- **A-roll / B-roll visual hierarchy** — video tracks are now classified as A-roll (main, accent border) or B-roll (secondary, muted saturation) using `TrackVisualSpec`. Each track label shows a role icon.
- **Media type labeling** — audio tracks display a waveform icon; text, sticker, effect, and filter tracks each have their own icon in the track label.
- **Resize handles are selection-only** — trim handles are hidden on unselected clips, removing accidental resize interactions.

### 🔊 Audio

- **Detach Audio** — right-click a video clip and choose **Detach Audio** to split the embedded audio into an independent audio clip on its own track. The operation is undoable.
- **Audio Extraction pipeline** — backend Tauri commands (`probe_media_streams`, `start_audio_extraction`, `cancel_media_job`, `get_media_job_result`) and a `mediaJobStore` lay the groundwork for background format-aware audio extraction.
- **Audio decoder seek fix** — the native audio seek now uses the global microseconds time-base (`AV_TIME_BASE`) instead of the stream's sample-rate time-base, preventing mis-seeks on clips with non-zero `trimIn`.
- **Preroll trimming** — decoded PCM preroll from keyframe-aligned seeks is trimmed before mixing so the audio starts at the exact requested source position.
- **Detached audio is invisible to the compositor** — clips with `kind === "audio"` are excluded from the visual evaluator and `PreviewMediaPool` video-element allocation.

### ⚡ Performance & Playback

- **Adaptive scrub quality** — playhead drag velocity is tracked in real time; fast scrubs request `quarter` or `half` quality and settle on a full-quality frame on release.
- **Seek generation tracking** — `SeekController` assigns a monotonically increasing generation to every seek so stale decode results can never overwrite a newer frame.
- **Native batch cancel** — `cancel_native_preview_requests` stops FFmpeg work at packet and frame boundaries when a newer seek arrives, with per-request `AbortController` cancellation in the JS scheduler.
- **Hardware acceleration re-enabled** — VideoToolbox (macOS), D3D11VA (Windows), and VAAPI (Linux) are active again with a `get_format` callback for per-frame pixel format negotiation.
- **Native playback queue doubled** — queue capacity increased from 3 to 6 frames for smoother continuous playback.
- **Filmstrip batch decode** — missing tiles are collected across an entire request, sorted chronologically, and decoded in chunks of 12 with a single GOP seek per chunk.
- **L0 tile pinning** — coarse filmstrip tiles (L0) are protected from LRU eviction; dense L1–L3 tiles absorb all eviction pressure first.
- **Per-file decode mutex** — concurrent zoom/scroll batch requests queue behind a per-file async mutex so the decoder is never stampeded.
- **RAF-coalesced zoom slider** — toolbar zoom drag now coalesces pointer move events to one update per animation frame.
- **Fit-sequence clamping fix** — "Fit Sequence" no longer clamps the zoom floor away; the overview level is preserved.

### 📊 Metrics & Telemetry

- **A/V sync metrics** — frontend (`syncMetrics.ts`) and Rust (`sync_metrics.rs`) modules track clock/poll drift, frame pacing jank, dropped frames, and end-to-end seek latency.
- **Filmstrip metrics HUD** — press **Cmd+Shift+M** to open the live debug overlay showing per-tier decode/convert timing (SRC, L0–L3), cache hit rates, A/V drift p95, UI playhead drift, and native seek correctness.
- **5-second aggregate logs** — both the Rust and JS metric collectors emit structured summaries every 5 seconds for profiling without log flood.
- **Per-stage timing** — batch decode now records separate seek, decode, convert, and serialize durations per tier.

### 🛠️ Editor & UX

- **Right-click context menus** — clip and empty-space context menus are available throughout the timeline with viewport-aware flip placement, grouped items, disabled-state hints, and keyboard shortcut labels.
- **Command registry** — all timeline editing actions (split, trim, delete, duplicate, swap, group, rename, close gaps) are routed through a shared `clipCommands`/`timelineCommands` registry for consistent keyboard, toolbar, and context-menu behavior.
- **Close All Gaps** — new toolbar command packs every unlocked track in one undoable transaction.
- **Preview scrub follows timeline** — paused preview scrubs keep the timeline playhead visible; selecting a clip from the program monitor scrolls it into view without jumping if it is already partially visible.
- **Active clip highlight** — clips under the program preview playhead glow with a subtle accent ring in program mode.
- **Full process exit on window close** — closing the app now calls `exit(0)` (macOS: `CloseRequested` handler) so the process does not linger after the window is dismissed.
- **Updater manifest URL rewrite** — CI now rewrites GitHub API asset URLs to direct public download URLs in `latest.json` and `updater.json` before publishing, fixing auto-update on all platforms.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-08-24

### 🖱️ Timeline Context Menus & Command Orchestration

- **Clip & Empty-Space Context Menus**: Introduced right-click context menus for timeline clips (`ClipContextMenu`) and empty track regions (`TimelineEmptySpaceContextMenu`), providing instant access to essential editing workflows (Cut, Copy, Duplicate, Split Clip at Playhead, Ripple Delete, Delete, Mute/Unmute, and Properties).
- **Viewport-Aware Context Menu Placement**: Upgraded `ContextMenu` with automated viewport collision detection and flip placement, grouped item support with visual dividers, disabled item states, and shortcut hint badges.
- **Unified Command Layer**: Added `useClipCommands` and `useTimelineCommands` hooks to centralize clip action execution across context menus, the timeline toolbar, and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Structured Clipboard Engine**: Introduced `ClipboardService` for structured multi-clip copy/paste and duplication with track index mapping, playhead offset calculation, and duplicate placement offsets.

### ⚡ Filmstrip & Thumbnail Decoding Optimizations

- **Single-Seek Forward GOP Sweep (`decode_frames_batch_full_res`)**: Accelerated batch thumbnail decoding in Rust by replacing repeated per-frame seeks with a single forward keyframe sweep per chunk.
- **Optimized Hardware Decoding & Color Conversion**: Added static HW-to-CPU frame transfers, format callbacks, `FAST_BILINEAR` 1:1 color conversion, and zero-swscale YUV420P→NV12 conversion paths.
- **Multi-Tier Raster & Pyramid Fallback**: Enhanced `webglRasterSurface` and `FilmstripTileCache` with L0 thumbnail protection/pinning during time-eviction, two-pass LRU cache eviction, and seamless pyramid fallback resolution during high-speed zoom and scrub.
- **Batch Serialization & Coalescing**: Added file-level mutex gating to prevent concurrent duplicate decodes of identical video files, normalized spatial tiers, and coalesced in-flight native batches.
- **Timeline Zoom Spring Synchronization**: Enhanced `useTimelineZoomSpring` and epoch debounce mechanisms to guarantee continuous zooming SLA (sub-150ms resolution) and prevent clip render churn.

### 📊 Real-Time Metrics & Performance HUD

- **Live Filmstrip Performance HUD (`FilmstripMetricsOverlay`)**: Added an in-editor diagnostics HUD toggled via `Cmd+Shift+M` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux) showing real-time frontend render timings and native Rust backend stats.
- **Frontend Telemetry**: Added telemetry tracking per-tier decode rates, request dispatch frequencies, cache hits/misses, first-artifact latencies, and paint commit durations.
- **Rust Backend Metrics Snapshot**: Added `get_decode_metrics_snapshot` Tauri invoke command backed by atomic metrics accumulators in the thumbnail engine.

### 🎯 UI Polish & Frontend React Optimization

- **Selective Store Subscriptions & Memoization**: Applied granular store selectors and `React.memo` across `TopBar`, `PropertiesPanel`, `Sidebar`, and `TimelineToolbar` to eliminate redundant re-render cycles.
- **Playback Clock Decoupling (`usePlaybackStatus`)**: Replaced high-frequency requestAnimationFrame clock subscriptions in timeline containers with discrete playback status hooks, stopping timeline re-renders on pure time ticks.
- **Reusable Outside-Click Dismissal (`useClickOutside`)**: Unified outside-click and Escape dismissal across layout menus, speed/aspect/quality popovers, and context menus.
- **Popover Stacking & Positioning**: Resolved stacking context and clipping issues in `PreviewTransport` popovers.

### 🖼️ Project Thumbnail Service

- **Background Project Cover Generation**: Added `ProjectThumbnailService` to automatically generate and cache project preview thumbnails in the background during save without blocking the UI thread or marking projects as dirty.
- **Auto-Save Suppression on Hydration**: Suppressed auto-save triggers during initial project loading and state hydration.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Process Lifecycle

- **macOS Window Close Process Exit**: Fixed a process hang on macOS window close by listening to the `CloseRequested` window event and cleanly terminating the process across all project states.
- **Auto-Updater Manifest Public URLs**: Fixed auto-updater manifest generation in CI to rewrite GitHub API asset URLs to public download URLs, ensuring unauthenticated clients can fetch update binaries reliably.
- **Cleaned Up Diagnostic Logs**: Removed noisy console logs and `eprintln` spam from hot rendering and playback paths.

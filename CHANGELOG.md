## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.1] - 2026-08-23

### 🔊 Native Audio Playback

- **Native Audio Output**: Added native CPAL audio playback with FFmpeg PCM decoding, timeline clip mixing, volume and mute control, and output-device handling.
- **Reliable Seek and Transport**: Fixed stale native clock samples and queued play, pause, and seek commands that could rewind playback to 0s or leave audio silent after seeking.
- **Audio Timeline Synchronization**: Refreshes native audio when clips and assets arrive after startup and keeps native runtime time aligned with the audio clock.
- **Audio Diagnostics**: Added focused audio tracing for decoded clips, device state, callback execution, rendered frames, and non-silent mixer output.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-23

### 🚀 Deep Native Migration

- **Native-First Preview and Playback**: Completed the migration of preview, scrubbing, transport, transitions, and source rendering onto the Tauri/Rust native media path.
- **Full Native Media Pipeline**: Unified native decoding, geometry and aspect handling, frame delivery, raster-surface ownership, filmstrip atlases and caching, and export frame pooling for consistent desktop playback and rendering.
- **Native Timeline Integration**: Connected timeline precision, snapping, waveform and envelope editing, gap and transition indicators, and source-time calculations to the native playback contract.
- **Native-Supported Editor Surface**: Reworked desktop and mobile layout composition, resizable panels, sidebar navigation, properties and empty states, and cache and settings flows around the native runtime.
- **Legacy Path Retirement**: Removed the legacy timeline controls and documented the mathematical invariants and performance contracts required by the native pipeline.

### 🧪 Validation

- Verified the TypeScript build, frontend suite, Rust backend suite, Clippy, focused 4K scrub stress, and production build.
- CI validates the frontend, Rust backend, and release build checks on the release PR.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-08-06

- **CI Syntax and Type Errors**: Fixed syntax and type errors in export renderers and timeline toolbar to ensure clean CI builds

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **NPM Package Migration**: Updated from local file references to published NPM packages (`@clypra-studio/engine@^1.1.0`, `@clypra-studio/shaders@^0.1.5`)
- **Build System**: Removed dependency on local clypra-studio source, now using official NPM registry for engine packages

### 🎬 Timeline Precision & Subsystems

- **Sequence End Marker & Boundary Line**: Added sequence end marker and boundary indicator line on the timeline ruler.
- **Unified Coordinate Calculation**: Replaced split pixel calculations in Clip, Gap, and Transition components with single-expression right-edge calculations (`timeToPixel(startTime + duration, pps)`) eliminating 1px boundary drift.
- **Dynamic Viewport Canvas Padding**: Updated timeline canvas duration calculations to include a 5s minimum canvas baseline with 2s look-ahead padding (`getTimelineCanvasDuration`).
- **Clip & Ruler Markers**: Added clip-level markers, ruler markers, and quick navigation.
- **Keyboard Shortcut System & Presets**: Fully customizable key bindings with industry standard preset maps.
